# Supersonar

> AI-powered sound recognition and spatial awareness system

## Overview

Supersonar is an innovative application that uses machine learning to identify sound sources, their directions, and characteristics. Initially focused on processing game audio (Minecraft) to recognize and visualize sound locations in a virtual environment, with plans to expand to real-world audio environments.

## Scalability Considerations

The system is designed to scale in several dimensions:
- From game audio to real-world environments
- From basic sound identification to complex audio scene analysis
- From desktop to mobile platforms
